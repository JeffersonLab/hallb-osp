 Files needed for the Hall B OPS Manual chapter on DAQ and
 Trigger are the following.  

    1. daq.tex   (the latex file)
    2. strig.pdf     (pdf figure)
 
 The file daq.tex compiles "as is".  But to incorporate
 it into a larger tex file one must comment out the stuff
 at the top (up to \begin{document}) and also the line at
 the end (\end {document})
