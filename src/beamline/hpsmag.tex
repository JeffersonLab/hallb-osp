\section{HPS Chicane Magnets}
}

The HPS experiment will use a three magnet chicane installed on the beamline in the Hall B downstream alcove. The chicane includes the Hall B pair spectrometer magnet, an 18D36 dipole, with its vacuum chamber, and two identical H-dipoles known as "Frascati" magnets. Electron beam will pass through the magnets in the vacuum. The pair spectrometer magnet will serve as a spectrometer magnet for HPS. The two "Frascati" dipoles are to keep the deflected electron beam on the beamline to the dump. The spectrometer magnet will be powered from the Hall B pair spectrometer magnet power supply, DANFYSIK-8000. The "Frascati" magnets will be powered from so called "mini-torus" power supply, Dynapower PD42-04000103-GKLX-PY57.   

\subsection{Hazards} 
\indent

Dipole magnets can present magnetic and electrical hazards when they are energized. There is also a possible hazard of unwonted beam motion if there is a magnet power trip.  



\subsection{Mitigations}
\indent

There are plastic covers on the connection panels for power leads on the magnets for electrical safety. Any work around the magnets will require de-energizing the magnets. Energized magnets are noted by red flashing beacons. Any work on the magnets requires a "Lock and Tag" procedure \cite{ehs}. There will be beacons installed to notify when magnetic field is present. The magnet power supplies will be interlocked to the beam shutdown system (FSD). If any of power supplies will trip, beam delivery to Hall B will be interrupted.

\subsection{Responsible  Personnel} 
\end{safetyen}
The chicane magnets will be maintained by the Hall B engineering group. The authorized personnel is shown in table \ref{tab:mag:personnel}.
