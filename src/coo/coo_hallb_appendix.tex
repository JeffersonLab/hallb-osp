Each shift requires a shift leader and a worker.  
A third person on shift is extremely useful, in particular for polarized target running, but not required. The shift leader 
has the standard
duties of shift leader to ensure proper data taking, log all activity, and to fill out
the Beam Accounting form.  The shift leader  runs the DAQ and the worker tkaes care of online monitoring.
This run period uses the "standard" Hall B equipment whose
use and safety procedures are documented in the Hall B OSP (Operation Safety
Procedures) available from the Hall B web page and wiki.
